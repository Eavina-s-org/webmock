KEY FEATURES:
    üé• Complete session recording (HTML, CSS, JS, images, API calls)
    üöÄ Local mock server for offline development
    üì¶ Efficient compressed storage
    üîß Developer-friendly CLI with progress indicators

QUICK START:
    # 1. Capture a web page
    webmock capture https://example.com --name my-site

    # 2. Start mock server  
    webmock serve my-site --port 8080

    # 3. Visit http://localhost:8080

COMMON WORKFLOWS:
    # Development against production APIs
    webmock capture https://app.com/dashboard --name prod-api --timeout 60
    webmock serve prod-api --port 8080

    # Testing with different data states  
    webmock capture https://app.com?user=admin --name admin-state
    webmock capture https://app.com?user=guest --name guest-state
    webmock serve admin-state --port 8081 & 
    webmock serve guest-state --port 8082 &

    # Demo preparation (works offline)
    webmock capture https://demo.myapp.com --name perfect-demo --timeout 90
    webmock serve perfect-demo --port 8080

    # CI/CD integration
    webmock capture https://api.com --name ci-baseline --timeout 120
    webmock serve ci-baseline --port 8080 &
    npm test  # Tests run against localhost:8080

MANAGEMENT:
    webmock list                    # View all snapshots
    webmock delete old-snapshot     # Clean up storage

REQUIREMENTS:
    ‚Ä¢ Google Chrome or Chromium browser
    ‚Ä¢ Internet connection (for capture)
    ‚Ä¢ ~/.webmock directory (auto-created)

    webmock <command> --help

1. Starts a local HTTP proxy to intercept requests
2. Launches a headless Chrome browser configured to use the proxy
3. Navigates to the specified URL and waits for the page to load
4. Records all network traffic during the session
5. Saves everything as a compressed snapshot file

EXAMPLES:

    webmock capture https://example.com --name my-site

    webmock capture https://api.example.com/dashboard --name dashboard --timeout 60

    # Capture with custom storage directory

    # Capture a local development site
    webmock capture http://localhost:3000 --name local-app
